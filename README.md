The tourism industry is developing day by day and the aim of the tourism industry is to 
improve the experience of tourists. Currently, it is not possible to manage resources 
properly in the face of global crises. Because of that blocking of investment 
opportunities, Cost rise, and Limited exposure to new experiences, have severely affected 
the tourism industry.
As a solution for this issue, the aim of our organization is to prepare decision–making 
methods based on data and analysis, centralize them, and provide that information as 
needed.For this purpose, the decisions coming from the domain experts are obtained through one 
centralized system, the suggestions are reviewed and an approval process is created by 
the organization. As an organization, we mainly focus on the below targets in SDG. 
12.6 – Encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices and sustainability reporting.
12.7 – Promote sustainable public procurement practices.
12. A – Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable tourism.
