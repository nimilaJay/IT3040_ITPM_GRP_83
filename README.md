The tourism industry is developing day by day and the aim of the tourism industry is to 
improve the experience of tourists. Currently, it is not possible to manage resources 
properly in the face of global crises. Because of that blocking of investment 
opportunities, Cost rise, and Limited exposure to new experiences, have severely affected 
the tourism industry.
As a solution for this issue, the aim of our organization is to prepare decision–making 
methods based on data and analysis, centralize them, and provide that information as 
needed.For this purpose, the decisions coming from the domain experts are obtained through one 
centralized system, the suggestions are reviewed and an approval process is created by 
the organization. As an organization, we mainly focus on the below targets in SDG. 
12.6 – Encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices and sustainability reporting.
12.7 – Promote sustainable public procurement practices.
12. A – Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable tourism. 

The Sustainable Tourism ERP Solution is a web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It is specifically designed to address the challenges faced by the tourism industry and enhance the overall tourist experience through data-driven decision-making and sustainability practices.

Key Objectives

The primary objectives of our Sustainable Tourism ERP Solution are as follows:

Improved Resource Management: By leveraging data and analysis, our solution aims to enable tourism businesses to manage their resources more effectively, leading to optimized operations and cost savings.

Centralized Decision-Making: We provide a centralized system where decisions, suggestions, and insights from domain experts can be collected and reviewed. This streamlines the decision-making process and ensures consistent and informed choices.

Sustainability Focus: Our organization is committed to promoting sustainable practices within the tourism industry. We align our solution with specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices, promote sustainable procurement, and monitor sustainable tourism.

Technology Stack
The Sustainable Tourism ERP Solution is built using the MERN stack, which includes:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and managing data related to tourism operations, sustainability metrics, and decision-making insights.

Express.js: A fast and flexible web application framework for building robust APIs to support data retrieval, processing, and communication with the frontend.

React.js: A JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. The frontend of our application is developed using React.js, providing an intuitive and seamless user experience.

Node.js: A server-side JavaScript runtime environment that enables the execution of JavaScript code on the server. It powers the backend of our application, handling data processing and serving API requests.
